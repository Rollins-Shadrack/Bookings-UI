The user interface (UI) allows users to access and explore various hotels when they visit the site. Users have the option to create an account, which grants them additional features and functionalities. Once logged in, users can upload the details of their own hotels to showcase them to other users.

The UI presents a user-friendly and intuitive design, with clear navigation menus and search options to help users find the desired hotels. The homepage displays a selection of featured hotels, along with their key details such as name, location, and pricing. Users can click on a hotel to view more detailed information, including descriptions, amenities, photos, and user reviews.

To create an account, users can follow a registration process that typically requires providing their personal information, such as name, email address, and password. Once registered, they can log in using their credentials to access their account dashboard.

In the account dashboard, hotel owners can upload and manage their hotel listings. They can add information such as hotel name, location, room types, facilities, pricing, and availability. They may also upload high-quality photos to showcase their hotels effectively.

Other users who are interested in booking hotels can browse through the available options and filter the search results based on criteria such as location, price range, amenities, and user ratings. When they find a hotel they wish to book, they can select the desired dates and room type, and proceed to make a reservation. The UI may provide a booking form where users can enter their details and complete the booking process securely.
